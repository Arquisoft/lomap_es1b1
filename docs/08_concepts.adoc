== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Domain

* *Location:* The application revolves around the concept of locations, which can be shops, restaurants, sights, museums, etc. Users can add personalized locations to their map. Users can also create reviews for locations created by other users. These reviews may include scores, comments or pictures. 
** Public location: A location that will be visible for every user in the application. Logged-in users will be able to create reviews for those locations. Stored in the application DB.
** Shared location: A location that will be visible and reviewable by the solid friends of the user that created it. Stored in the user pod.
** Private location: A location that will be visible only to the creator. Stored in the user pod.

* *Personalized maps:* The application allows users to have their own personalized map, with the locations they create. They can also see the map with the public locations and a map with their friend's locations.

=== User Experience

* *Map filters:* The ability for users to filter the map by category, friends, and other criteria, which helps them find the places they are interested in more easily.


=== Safety and security
* *Privacy:* The application must ensure the privacy of its users. The information about a place stored by each user should not be centralized and should be stored in each user's pod. No data from the user is stored in the database. Only public locations are stored in the DB. Security is a quality goal for the architecture, and the system must respect the privacy of the users.

* *Access control:* The system must have appropriate access controls in place to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify personal and shared data.

* *Secure data storage:* The system must ensure that data stored in user pods and other centralized data stores is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

=== Interoperability
* The solution must be designed in a way that allows for interoperabilitybetween the data stored by different applications. We have followed theproposed specification with a few changes (two extra fields for thelocations) for implementing the different visibility options that ourapplications offers.
