==== Motivation:
During the development and testing phases, each student will run the runtime environment on their own machine. However, once the system is ready for production, it will be deployed on Azure in a Dockerised environment. It is important that we understand Docker as the infrastructure on which our system will be deployed.

==== Quality and/or performance features:
The performance of the deployment build relies on both the user's internet connection and the Azure servers used for the app's deployment, which are beyond our control. However, we can optimize the application's performance by using certain coding techniques. Our primary concerns in achieving the best and most secure user experience will be privacy and security.

==== Mapping of building blocks to infrastructure:
|===
|*Element*|*Description*

|*WebApp*|The front-end of our application. It will be displayed on the user's device through the execution of a web browser.
|*REST API*|Part of our application's back-end. It will be hosted on the Azure server.
|*MongoDB*|The chosen database, in which all information that is not stored in the pods for privacy and/or performance reasons will be stored.
|*Pod provider*|Supplier of the pods to be used.
|*Google Maps API*|API used to display a map and user-created locations.
