|Constraint
|Explanation

|*SOLID*
|In order to protect the privacy of our customers, it is necessary to follow the SOLID principles.

|*Github*
|Git is used for managing version control and the repository is hosted on Github. Additionally, Github provides tools for communication and project organization.

|*Continuous Integration System*
|We will employ Docker to deploy the application and have a virtual machine allocated in Azure for this purpose.

|Constraint
|Explanation

|*Testing*
|Various scenarios will be considered to verify the correct behavior of the application. Multiple techniques will be employed to test the application and achieve the highest possible level of coverage.

|*Meetings*
|As only one of us can come to the lab, the meetings will be telematic. Information on these meetings can be found https://github.com/Arquisoft/lomap_es1b1/wiki[here].

|*Team size* 
|The team consists of only two people. If one of us were to leave, the other would be in a very difficult situation.

|*Due dates*
|We have to meet the deadlines for handing in the project. These coincide with the deadlines for the evaluation of the subject.

|*Experience* 
|Regardless of our knowledge of the technologies used, this is the first time we have implemented a real-life project.

|*Working as a team*
|This is the first time that the two of us have worked as a team.

|*Coordination*
|We must coordinate properly to avoid problems like those that happened in the previous team.

|Explanation

|*SOLID*
|The application must follow the https://github.com/solid/solid-spec[SOLID] specification.

|*Language*
|The application should be designed so that any English-speaking person can interact with it and perform any task successfully.

|*Clean code*
|The code that makes up the application must be written in a clean and efficient way to facilitate understanding and maintainability.

|*Accessibility*
|The application should be designed for ease of navigation, ensuring that users with any disability can use it without difficulty.

|*Documentation*
|The documentation should be written according to the https://arc42.org/[Arc42] method, which emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and effectiveness.

|*Programming language conventions*
|It is important to respect the coding conventions of the programming languages we use.
