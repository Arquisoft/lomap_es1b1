|Priority

|*Privacy*|The application shall store only the necessary information in a decentralised manner.|Only information relating to locations shall be stored. The information provided in the registration form and during the checkout process is not stored, but rather obtained from the POD.|We have implemented a fully integrated login system with pod providers to avoid taking unnecessary information.|_High_

|*Usability*|The user will not be able to create locations if the interface is not sufficiently clear and intuitive.|Anyone without prior knowledge of the application will be able to complete any task in a reasonable amount of time.|We have simplified the interface to avoid unintuitive processes and/or sections.|_High_

|*Security*|Users will not trust our application if we do not store their data in a secure place.|The data must not be accessible to any third party.|As the privacy requirement is closely associated with security, we have made numerous adjustments to the application to ensure maximum protection.|_High_

|*Reliability*|Errors in the application must be handled by the application itself, without crashing under any circumstances.|The user shall have no knowledge of such errors, except for those that must necessarily be communicated to the user.|A considerable amount of effort will be dedicated to error prevention, as it is closely tied to maintainability. When implementing a feature, there is much more involved than simply making it functional.|_High_

|*Maintainability*|Our application will undergo many changes, so we need to develop it in a way that makes it easy to maintain in the future.|We aim to make as few errors per line of code as possible.|Investing greater effort in implementing a new feature can lead to significant rewards when modifications are made later on.|_Medium_

|*Freedom*|We are developing the application on a greenfield basis. We intend to save unnecessary effort for those working on it in the future by including the code with plenty of documentation in a public repository.|The project must be available in its entirety in a public repository accessible by anyone at any time.|A repository that is accessible to the public and contains a record of every discussion, issue, or decision made.|_Medium_
