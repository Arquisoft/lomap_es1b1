== Risks and Technical Debts

“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

_(It will obviously be extended as we find new risks and generate others technical debts as we develop the application.)_

.Risks
|===
|Priority |Problem description |Considerations

|Medium
|Huge dimension of the project
|The quality and readability of the developement solutions are mandatory in order to keep order

|Medium
|Time availability of memebers of the developement team
|Good organization and distribution of the project work along the semester

|Medium
|Experience
|Regardless of our knowledge of the technologies used, this is the first time we have implemented a real-life project.

|High
|New technology
|Most of the technologies of the project are new for us and we have little experience in web development.

|Low
|Working as a team
|This is the first time that the two of us have worked as a team.

|Medium
|Coordination
|We must coordinate properly to avoid problems like those that happened in the previous team.

.Technical Debts
|===
|Technical Debts | Considerations

|Some small functional features | As a result of prioritizing other aspects, some interesting features have not been implemented, such as transforming a public location into a private one or vice versa, filtering locations by friend in a clean and straightforward way, etc.

|Some small usability features | As a result of prioritizing other aspects, the app lacks the usual feedback of a profesional application. For example, confirmation dialogs when deleting, messages when an operation has been successfully completed, etc.

|Testing | We have achieved a 70% of coverage, but we expected to be able to achieve at least 80%.

|E2E Testing | We have not performed many e2e tests (5), since we can not log in the application in these tests and most of the features are only available for logged-in users.

|Deployment | For using the solid login, we need to deploy the application with https. However, we can not use the restapi correctly using this protocol, so the deployed application is lacking the part related to the database.
