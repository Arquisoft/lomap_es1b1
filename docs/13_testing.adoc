== Testing

=== Unitary testing
For the creation of unit tests we have used the Jest libraries and, in the case of the components found in the webapp, the React Testing Library. In the webapp, the correct operation and rendering of each individual component is tested, the functions that call data from the pod or the database have been mockerized with functions that return prepared data. 

We have achieved almost 70% of code coverage. Although a higher percentage would be optimal or required in a real environment, it is a good result considering that most of the application relies on a google map which makes it more difficult to test.

=== End-to-End testing
The Jest and Cucumber libraries have been used to create e2e tests. Cucumber allows the tests to be performed with the Given, When, Then user story syntax. Examples of acceptance test would be:


****
Feature: Login

Scenario: The user logs in

  Given An user in the home page
  When The user clicks on the login button
  Then It opens the login dialog 
****

****
Feature: Map view

Scenario: The user opens the filters

  Given An user in the map page
  When The user clicks on the filters button
  Then It opens the filters dialog

Scenario: The user selects the public locations map

  Given An user in the map page
  When The user clicks on the combo box and selects public locations
  Then The public locations are displayed

****

****
Feature: HomePage

Scenario: The user views the map page of the app

  Given An user in the home page
  When The user clicks on the map link in the navbar
  Then The map page should be shown

Scenario: The user clicks on the Let's get started button

  Given An user in the home page
  When The user clicks on the button
  Then The map page should be shown

=== Static analysis
We have used SonarCloud in our project to enhance the maintainability of the project and reducing the code smells and security issues.

=== Load testing
We have used Gatling to perform some load testing. As there was not a number of users specified in the requirements, we first started with a rampUsersPerSec configuration. Starting with 2 users and scaling each second, we noticed that our application reached its limit with 10 simultaneous users.

We performed a stress test after that, with 20 simultaneous users with the atOnceUsers configuration.
