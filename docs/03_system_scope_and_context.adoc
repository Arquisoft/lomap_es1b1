| *Entity* | Input | Output
| *User* | The user interacts with the application through a device, experiencing the frontend and sending requests to the backend. | The user will create his pod, in which his information will be stored and will operate the application to create locations.
| *User POD* | Receives requests to modify or obtain personal information and locations created by the user. | Stores and/or returns the information requested by the user.
| *MongoDB* | The database receives requests to create or obtain locations not stored in the POD for performance reasons. | Stores and/or returns the information requested by the user.
| *LoMap System* | The user interacts with this system by sending requests through the interface. | It processes incoming requests, manages the database to ensure consistency, and then displays the requested information to the user via the interface.

=== Technical Context

According to the SOLID project, shared information will be stored in each user's POD. In addition, we will implement the application using TypeScript together with React for Front-end development. Finally; we will make use of MongoDB, a NoSQL database system; and an endpoint using NodeJS with Express.
